ThreadPool Management
ThreadPool Basics

ThreadPool vs. Individual Threads:

    Using the ThreadPool is beneficial for scenarios with many short-lived tasks or asynchronous operations, as it avoids the overhead of creating and destroying threads constantly.
    Individual threads are explicitly created and managed by developers. While they offer more control, managing a large number of threads can lead to resource exhaustion.

Default Settings and Configuration:

    The ThreadPool has default settings that are automatically managed by the runtime.
    You can configure the ThreadPool using methods like SetMaxThreads and SetMinThreads to set the maximum and minimum number of threads, influencing how the ThreadPool manages its resources.

// Example: Configuring the ThreadPool
ThreadPool.SetMinThreads(5, 5);
ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads(20, 20);
