Thread Synchronization

Thread synchronization is a crucial element of managing these parallel operations smoothly. It ensures that threads coordinate and communicate effectively, preventing conflicts that may arise when multiple threads access shared resources.

Challenges such as deadlocks may occur in Thread Synchronization, where threads are stuck waiting for each other to proceed. In those cases it is required to implement strategies to prevent deadlocks, ensuring efficient collaboration among threads and optimal performance of the application.
