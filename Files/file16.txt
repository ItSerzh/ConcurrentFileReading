Thread and Task Prioritization
Adjusting thread and task priorities

Thread and task priorities can be adjusted using Thread.Priority. In this example, we create a high-priority and a low-priority thread:

using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Thread highPriorityThread = new Thread(() =>
        {
            Thread.CurrentThread.Priority = ThreadPriority.Highest;
            Console.WriteLine("High-Priority Thread");
        });

        Thread lowPriorityThread = new Thread(() =>
        {
            Thread.CurrentThread.Priority = ThreadPriority.Lowest;
            Console.WriteLine("Low-Priority Thread");
        });

        highPriorityThread.Start();
        lowPriorityThread.Start();

        Console.WriteLine("Main Thread Exiting");
    }
}

Impact on overall system performance

While adjusting thread or task priorities can influence the order in which they are scheduled, it’s crucial to consider the impact on overall system performance. Extensive adjustments might affect the fairness of the scheduler and potentially lead to priority inversion. It’s advisable to use priority adjustments judiciously.
Conclusion

To sum it up, learning C# concurrency, including threads, tasks, and the ThreadPool, is key for building responsive applications. Learning about parallel execution, best practices, and advanced considerations ensures smoother development and enhances the overall C# concurrency experience.
