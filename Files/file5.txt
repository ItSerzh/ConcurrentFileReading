Task vs. Thread: Key Differences

While tasks and threads both represent units of work, they differ in several key aspects:

Threading Model: Threads are managed by the operating system, while tasks are managed by the runtime environment.

Resource Management: Threads require explicit resource management, while tasks are managed by the runtime.

Exception Handling: Thread-based exceptions can be difficult to handle, while tasks provide a structured approach to exception handling.
